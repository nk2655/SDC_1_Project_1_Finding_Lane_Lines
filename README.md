# SDC_Finding_Lane_Lines_on_the_Road
One of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm. In this project we will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.
